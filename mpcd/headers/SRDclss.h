/// @note
/// Setting fixed boundary surfaces or initializing mobile surfaces uses the variables:

/// - `AINV[3]` the "semi-axes" of the surface (as in an ellipsoid), which are the coefficients in front of each cartesion term, \f$\vec{A}\f$. 
/// - `R` for the shift term (as in the radius of a sphere), \f$ R \f$. 
/// - `P[4]` the powers  of each cartesion term, \f$\vec{p}\f$. 
///

/// @note
/// Boundary surface take on a general form of
/// - \f$ \mathcal{S} = \left( \frac{x-Q_x}{A_x} \right)^{p_x} + \left( \frac{y-Q_y}{A_y} \right)^{p_y} + \left( \frac{z-Q_z}{A_z} \right)^{p_z} - R^{p_R} = 0 \f$ where the

/// 	+ radius (or scalar shift) \f$ R \f$, which has the variable name `R`
/// 	+ powers on each cartesian term \f$ \vec{p} \f$, which has the variable name `P`
/// - The surface equation becomes `( A[0]*(x-Q[0]) )^P[0] + (A[1]*(y-Q[1]))^P[1] + (A[2]*(z-Q[2]))^P[2] - R^P[3] = 0`.

/// Some common examples:

/// - PLANE:    `A=normal`, `p=[1,1,1,1]`, `Q=point on plane`, `R=0`
/// - CIRCLE:   `A=[1,1,1]`, `p=[2,2,2,2]`, `Q=centre`, `R=radius`
/// - ELLIPSE:  `A=focii`, `p=[2,2,2,2]`, `Q=centre`, `R=1`
/// - SQUIRCLE: `A=[1,1,1,1]`, `p>=4` (even), `Q=centre`, `R=radius`
///
///	There are additional complications:
///	1. An absolute operator can be used by turning on the `ABS` flag, which puts absolute operators around the terms:
///		- \f$ \mathcal{S} = \left| \frac{x-Q_x}{A_x} \right|^{p_x} + \left| \frac{y-Q_y}{A_y} \right|^{p_y} + \left| \frac{z-Q_z}{A_z} \right|^{p_z} - R^{p_R} = 0 \f$
///	2. This only allows a certain subset of rotational symmetries (even and less than or equal to 4-fold). For
///     different symmetries, we have ROTSYMM[2]. Let:
///     - `r=sqrt( (x-Q[0])^2 + (y-Q[1])^2 + (z-Q[2])^2 )`
///		- `phi=atan2( (y-Q[1])/(x-Q[0]) )`
///		- `theta=arccos( (z-Q[2])/r )`
///		- `abs( A[0]*cos(ROTSYMM[0]*phi/4)*sin(ROTSYMM[1]*theta/4) )^P[0]`
///				 `+ abs( A[1]*cos(ROTSYMM[0]*phi/4)*sin(ROTSYMM[1]*theta/4) )^P[1]`
///					`+ abs( A[2]*cos(ROTSYMM[0]*phi/4)*sin(ROTSYMM[1]*theta/4) )^P[2] - (R/r)^P[4] = 0`
